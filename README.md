# Resume

Hello! My name is Nat, based in sydney! 

I'm currently in phase 0, taking a Software Engineering course at [Academy Xi](https://academyxi.com/).

Please take a look at my drafted resume in HTML and CSS via [this link](https://natmiji.github.io/Resume/) where I learned to structure and style web content.

Next on my agenda is delving into JavaScript and its frameworks, with the aim of creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

In the upcoming year of 2024, I'm thrilled to explore frontend frameworks like React, while simultaneously venturing into backend development with Python.

Come join me as I navigate this ever-evolving realm of web development. Let's learn, build, and grow together! Feel free to connect for potential collaboration as well.
